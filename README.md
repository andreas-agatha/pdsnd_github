### Project Title: Analyzing US bikeshare data with Python ###

### Description
This project consists of a Python script that imports raw bikeshare data from Chicago, New York City and Washington, DC. The script provides an interactive user experience with the data, starting with several options and data filters to choose from (city, data month, weekday). Aggregated data will be displayed based on selected filters and provides insights such as most popular rental times, rental stations, trip durations, and - as far as available - customer-related information. Raw data can be shown by user request to satisfy further needs to explore excerpts of the aggregated data.

### Files used
Key to the GitHub project is the Python script "py_bikeshare.py", which is the main subject for code development. The project uses separate csv files for each city, serving as the data foundation for the Python application. Due to size constraints, the actual data files are part of a .gitignore file and therefore neither visible nor accessible in the remote GitHub project.

### Credits
I'd like to credit all available Udacity teaching material that has enabled me to realize this first programming project. This knowledge foundation has been enhanced by several case-related GitHub and Stackoverflow online articles. For the coding work, the official Python and Pandas documentations must be mentioned as reliable sources for code challenges.
